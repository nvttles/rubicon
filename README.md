Welcome to Rubicon, a nonsense CLI tool made for Ruby, with Ruby. With this you can use a bunch of random commands such as fun commands all the way to complex math! This is not used for anything in particular, nor do I expect it to garner any attention. I just made this for fun! More about [ **RUBY**: Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. ] More about [ **RUBY GEMS**: RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. ] If I have used your package in this, please let me know if you are not comfortable with it! I will remove it and improvise if you wish me to do so.
