Please take notice, this is *STILL* in development.

**Introduction** ---
Welcome to Rubicon, a nonsense CLI tool made for Ruby, with Ruby. With this you can use a bunch of random commands such as fun commands all the way to complex math! This is not used for anything in particular, nor do I expect it to garner any attention. I just made this for fun! If I have used your package in this, please let me know if you are not comfortable with it! I will remove it and improvise if you wish me to do so.

**Information** ---
[ **RUBY**: Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. ]
[ **RUBY GEMS**: RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. ]

**Conclusion** ---
This gem mainly focuses on simplifying math in Ruby! You can do many things like adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, powers, etc. There are also a few commands that focus on the fun of the console. Thank you so much for reading this!
